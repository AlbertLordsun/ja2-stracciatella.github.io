# Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella

An improved, cross-platform, stable Jagged Alliance 2 runtime.

The goal of the project is to make Jagged Alliance 2 available on a wide range of platforms, improve its stability, fix bugs and provide a stable platform for mod development. Moddability is still in the early stages.

Data files from the original game are still required and will be used by JA2-Stracciatella.
