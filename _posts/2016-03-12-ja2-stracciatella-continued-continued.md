title: JA2 Stracciatella Continued Continued
---

Again there has been a regroup of Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella developers.
Development has gained pace and a new release is on the horizon.

After the development in the last repository stalled, because the original owner didn't
have the time to maintain the project anymore the active developers decided to
take responsibiliy of that. This
introduces some major changes to our infrastructure

- We now have this beautiful website to inform you about the development process
  and new releases
- Development is now taking place at [Github](https://github.com/ja2-stracciatella/ja2-stracciatella)

We hope these changes speed up the development process significantly and we
can bring you a new release soon.
