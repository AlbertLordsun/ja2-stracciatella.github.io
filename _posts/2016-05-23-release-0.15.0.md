The new Jagged Alliance 2 Stracciatella team is proud to present you with their
first release. This is mainly a bugfix release and to reestablish the development.
Therefore it does not bring a ton of new features but straightens a lot of
stuff out. Larger changes have been postponed to the next version, so expect a
more interesting changelog in the months to come.

__New Features__:
* Our new logo is now used as the application icon
* Using the brothels, ehm, services is now possible
* Improvements to the OpenBSD/FreeBSD builds

Additionally we are now shipping pre-built packages for Ubuntu, Windows and
OS X. This should help users to easily get started with Jagged Alliance 2
Stracciatella.
