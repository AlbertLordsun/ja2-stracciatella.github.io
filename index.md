## Features

While much of the focus of the project is on fixing bugs through cleaning up and modernizing the code, several minor and major [new features](features.md) (the chocolate that makes vanilla stracciatella) have been added as well. Additionally, many optional tweaks are only a [configuration](how-to-run.md/#extra-configuration-and-modding) switch away.
