Jagged Alliance 3, an official, direct sequel to JA2 is the game that just didn't happen (yet). There were some serious attempts, including one made by Sirtech Canada itself, before they went out of business, and the one by GFI, which later became Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge.
Not only is there no game out there that is called Jagged Alliance 3, but (more importantly) there is also no sequel so far that manages to satisfy the fans of the series and/or to be a general success.
