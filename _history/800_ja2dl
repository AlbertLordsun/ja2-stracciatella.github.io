The release of the map editor together with UB spawned hundreds of user-made maps and campaigns.
SOG'69 is one of the most popular user-made campaigns (if no **the** most popular) for UB ever made.
It takes the player to the Vietnam war, which is a totally new setting for a Jagged Alliance game.
The amount of content and it's high level of immersion is second to none. This mod is an absolute must-play for everyone who owns UB.

This fatal event can be regarded as a turning point in the history of Jagged Alliance.
Sirtech Canada Ltd. was the last division of Sir-Tech Inc., which was the publisher and/or developer of every Jagged Alliance game so far. Concerning official sequels, things really went downhill from here on.

UC is a true masterpiece and definitely one of the greatest mods for vanilla JA2 ever made. It's basically a full conversion mod that offers a whole new storyline and a new campaign in a brand-new setting.
UC is even more impressive when you consider the fact, that it was developed without any access to JA2's sourcecode, which was still about to be released.

status: fan-made mod for JA2 / official sequel to JA2 
---

What started as a free mod for JA2 eventually became a commercial project. The final game isn't a true sequel to JA2 and feels more like a remake. While the engine and the game's content were altered (e.g. maps, weapons, mercs), the story remains unchanged. 
Because of severe problems between the developer and the publisher, two different commercial versions of this are floating around: v5 and v6, which are completely incompatible: v5 can't be upgraded to v6 and v6-specific patches can't be applied to v5.
As with JA2 Gold, things are a bit confusing here. There are three different releases of WF:
+ old releases ≤ version 4, which are free mods
+ version 5, which is a commercial release
+ version 6, which is a different commercial release

WF got mixed reviews. It's main issues are the somewhat unbalanced gameplay, the rather large number of bugs and the fact that it runs on the JA2 engine. While the engine was modified to support higher resolutions, it was nevertheless absolutely outdated when WF came out.

The sourcecode is the basis for the JA2 Stracciatella project and many other great mods, including the v1.13 mod. It was released together 
with WF. The sourcecode was released with a license that basically allows modders to create non-commercial projects with it.

---

The v1.13 mod is a massive mod that changes just about every aspect of the game and introduces tons of features. It is impossible to completely list even the most important features here, because there are so many of them.
Some of the features are:
tons of new items, a weather-system, a new AP-system, a new CtH-system, possibility to have much bigger maps, all the mercs from 
JA1 included, and much more...
v1.13 is also a platform for several other mods. Some major mods based on v1.13 include Arulco Folding Stock, AIMNAS and Arulco Revisited.
[The Bear's Pit Forum](http://thepit.ja-galaxy-forum.com/) is the main hangout for the JA2 v1.13 community.

dev: Apeiron 
status: unofficial sequel / "spiritual" successor 
---

This game started as a fan-project, titled Project E5. After some years of development, Russian publisher 1C bought the project and further development eventually lead us to the game we got.
Brigade: E5 is the first game in a series of sequels, successors and spin-offs that all try to either be a remake of JA2 or a sequel to it, without calling themselves "JA3". It's also the first "modern" (modern = after JA2) game in the Jagged Alliance universe.
Brigade E5 features some good 3D graphics for its time. And that's about the most positive thing there is to say about this game. On the bad side, it's full of bugs and the gameplay is mediocre at best.

JA2 Stracciatella was started by Tron and run by him solo for a loooong time. Besides the v1.13 mod, JA2 Stracciatella is the biggest mod with the longest and steadiest development time for JA2. Since it's very beginning, the goal of JA2 Stracciatella was to modernize and improve the game, without altering its gameplay.

In the mid-2000s, Russian developer GFI was commissioned to develop two Jagged Alliance games by the IP holder of the Jagged Alliance franchise, Strategy First. These two games were supposed to be Jagged Alliance 3, a sequel to JA2, and Jagged Alliance 3D, a remake of JA2, just with better graphics.
To cut a long and strange story short: Things went horribly wrong. In the end, no official sequel or remake were developed by GFI and Strategy First withdrew the rights on the Jagged Alliance franchise from GFI. What we got in the end was Jazz: Hired Guns, later renamed to Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge. This game was originally developed to be Jagged Alliance 3D. But since GFI had no rights on the IP anymore, the game was renamed.
And how does it play? – The very first impression is "JA2 with a new graphic engine". Sounds good so far. However, it also features a bad AI, frustrating gameplay and a bunch of bugs. Like many games on this list, Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge underwent a troubled development, which concluded in a strange and dubious release. It quickly drifted off into obscurity.

status: sequel to Brigade E5: New Jagged Union 
---

This is the direct sequel to Brigade E5. Although it was released in Russia in 2007, an international release didn't happen until late 2008. This game has a small but loyal fan base but didn't gain too much attention overall. An add-on named 7.62: Reloaded was released, but apparently only in Russia. This game lead to the development of a mod called Blue Sun Mod, which is a complete overhaul for this game. It is one of the few instances, where playing a modded game without having ever played the vanilla game is absolutely advised!
Overall, it's an okay-ish game. Maybe it would have been perceived more positively, if people didn't compare it to JA2 all the time.

status: official re-release of JA1 
---

This is mostly just a re-release of the original JA1. Some minor gameplay elements were changed. While this whole project was definitely a very nice idea, it also showed, how badly the first Jagged Alliance game has aged.
And by badly aged, I'm not referring to the graphics, but to the controls and interface, which are by far less userfriendly than in JA2.
Now, if they would have ported JA2, that would have been truly amazing!

An average free2play aka pay2win multiplayer online game with the Jagged Alliance name on it. A new low-point for the franchise.
This game is not available anymore. Jagged Alliance Online has been converted into Jagged Alliance Online: Reloaded in 2015. More about that game later...

---

A remake of JA2. While it's not really a bad game, the only new and innovative thing BiA brought to the Jagged Alliance franchise besides better graphics is: DLC's. And thinking about it... this is in fact a very bad thing.
Obligatory DLC-rant aside, this game and it's sequel are probably the best "modern" games with the Jagged Alliance name on them. Of course, this doesn't mean too much, since the competition with everything on this list after JA2 is rather weak.

The official sequel to BiA. Both Crossfire and BiA were released within 2012. Not to mention all the DLC's, which were also released in the same year. So, judging just from the raw numbers, do you really expect this to be an original, innovative, high quality game?
As with BiA, Crossfire isn't really a bad game, but compared to JA2, it's safe to call it pale and soulless.

It had become a bit quiet around the Stracciatella project.

Game developer Full Control bought the Jagged Alliance franchise in 2013 and started what is so far the latest attempt at making a worthy sequel to JA2. 
Interestingly, this game was partly crowdfunded on Kickstarter and backed with $368.614. It's the first game in the Jagged Alliance franchise to be crowdfunded. Unfortunately, this game could neither convince the fanbase, nor was it a critical or commercial success in general. Several features which were supposed to be added to the game post-release were not realized. Needless to mention that Full Control games went bankrupt shortly after the release... a common pattern when dealing with the Jagged Alliance franchise...
Once more, Jagged Alliance got a sequel of mediocre quality which looks, plays and feels like a watered-down version of JA2 with improved graphics. To put this game in one (sad) word: **FAIL!**

This is basically the same game as JAO, but it changed from a free2play title to a classic buy2play game.
This is definitely a huge step forward, but this game is nevertheless not very good. It has some DLC's available, but that doesn't improve the situation. JAO and AO:R are probably the most obscure titles in this list.

Jagged Alliance 3, an official, direct sequel to JA2 is the game that just didn't happen (yet). There were some serious attempts, including one made by Sirtech Canada itself, before they went out of business, and the one by GFI, which later became Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge.
Not only is there no game out there that is called Jagged Alliance 3, but (more importantly) there is also no sequel so far that manages to satisfy the fans of the series and/or to be a general success.
