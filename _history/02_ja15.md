Unlike JA1, DG is mission-based, offers a multiplayer mode and a map editor. It runs on the same engine as JA1 and is often referred 
to as Jagged Alliance 1.5.
When it first came out, DG was widely viewed as just an add-on for JA1 or a mission-pack. This was probably because it looked more or less the same and also shared most of it's content. Nevertheless, it's an original and very special game in the Jagged Alliance series and its unique playstyle, with its multiplayer mode, hasn't really been duplicated so far.
By the way, both JA1 and DG were re-released on Steam as the [Jagged Alliance: Gold Edition](http://store.steampowered.com/app/283270/?) in 2015 by THQ Nordic GmbH Games.
