UB aka JA 2.5 runs on a slightly modified JA2 engine. The gameplay is more or less the same as before, but large portions of JA2's features were cut out to allow for a more streamlined and action-orientated gameplay. This is especially true for almost the whole strategic part of JA2.
After it's release, this standalone add-on was heavily criticized for it's short campaign and somewhat crippled gameplay. And indeed, veterans of JA2 are able to complete UB's campaign in a single session, lasting only a few hours. UB also suffers from a horrible localization. A fact, which becomes even more obvious since JA2's localization was excellent.
However, despite all criticism, UB introduced two great features: The inclusion of the map editor and the possibility to import mercs from JA2.
Similar to DG, UB was widely regarded as just some sort of mission-pack to its predecessor, leaving the fans hungry for more.
