Game developer Full Control bought the Jagged Alliance franchise in 2013 and started what is so far the latest attempt at making a worthy sequel to JA2. 
Interestingly, this game was partly crowdfunded on Kickstarter and backed with $368.614. It's the first game in the Jagged Alliance franchise to be crowdfunded. Unfortunately, this game could neither convince the fanbase, nor was it a critical or commercial success in general. Several features which were supposed to be added to the game post-release were not realized. Needless to mention that Full Control games went bankrupt shortly after the release... a common pattern when dealing with the Jagged Alliance franchise...
Once more, Jagged Alliance got a sequel of mediocre quality which looks, plays and feels like a watered-down version of JA2 with improved graphics. To put this game in one (sad) word: **FAIL!**
