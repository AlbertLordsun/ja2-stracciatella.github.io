The v1.13 mod is a massive mod that changes just about every aspect of the game and introduces tons of features. It is impossible to completely list even the most important features here, because there are so many of them.
Some of the features are:
tons of new items, a weather-system, a new AP-system, a new CtH-system, possibility to have much bigger maps, all the mercs from 
JA1 included, and much more...
v1.13 is also a platform for several other mods. Some major mods based on v1.13 include Arulco Folding Stock, AIMNAS and Arulco Revisited.
[The Bear's Pit Forum](http://thepit.ja-galaxy-forum.com/) is the main hangout for the JA2 v1.13 community.
