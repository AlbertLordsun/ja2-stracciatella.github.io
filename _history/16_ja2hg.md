In the mid-2000s, Russian developer GFI was commissioned to develop two Jagged Alliance games by the IP holder of the Jagged Alliance franchise, Strategy First. These two games were supposed to be Jagged Alliance 3, a sequel to JA2, and Jagged Alliance 3D, a remake of JA2, just with better graphics.
To cut a long and strange story short: Things went horribly wrong. In the end, no official sequel or remake were developed by GFI and Strategy First withdrew the rights on the Jagged Alliance franchise from GFI. What we got in the end was Jazz: Hired Guns, later renamed to Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge. This game was originally developed to be Jagged Alliance 3D. But since GFI had no rights on the IP anymore, the game was renamed.
And how does it play? â€“ The very first impression is "JA2 with a new graphic engine". Sounds good so far. However, it also features a bad AI, frustrating gameplay and a bunch of bugs. Like many games on this list, Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge underwent a troubled development, which concluded in a strange and dubious release. It quickly drifted off into obscurity.
