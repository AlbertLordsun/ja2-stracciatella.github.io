This is the direct sequel to Brigade E5. Although it was released in Russia in 2007, an international release didn't happen until late 2008. This game has a small but loyal fan base but didn't gain too much attention overall. An add-on named 7.62: Reloaded was released, but apparently only in Russia. This game lead to the development of a mod called Blue Sun Mod, which is a complete overhaul for this game. It is one of the few instances, where playing a modded game without having ever played the vanilla game is absolutely advised!
Overall, it's an okay-ish game. Maybe it would have been perceived more positively, if people didn't compare it to JA2 all the time.
