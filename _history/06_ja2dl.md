Although it's debatable if DL has aged as well as other mods like, for example Urban Chaos, DL is still a very special mod.
DL was the first large-scale mod for JA2. It was extremely popular back in the old days and, because of it's sheer amount of content, it was also a milestone in JA2-modding.
Apart from its technical aspects, it was, and of course still is, also just fun to play.
