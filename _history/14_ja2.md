This game started as a fan-project, titled Project E5. After some years of development, Russian publisher 1C bought the project and further development eventually lead us to the game we got.
Brigade: E5 is the first game in a series of sequels, successors and spin-offs that all try to either be a remake of JA2 or a sequel to it, without calling themselves "JA3". It's also the first "modern" (modern = after JA2) game in the Jagged Alliance universe.
Brigade E5 features some good 3D graphics for its time. And that's about the most positive thing there is to say about this game. On the bad side, it's full of bugs and the gameplay is mediocre at best.
