The official sequel to BiA. Both Crossfire and BiA were released within 2012. Not to mention all the DLC's, which were also released in the same year. So, judging just from the raw numbers, do you really expect this to be an original, innovative, high quality game?
As with BiA, Crossfire isn't really a bad game, but compared to JA2, it's safe to call it pale and soulless.
