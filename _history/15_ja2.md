JA2 Stracciatella was started by Tron and run by him solo for a loooong time. Besides the v1.13 mod, JA2 Stracciatella is the biggest mod with the longest and steadiest development time for JA2. Since it's very beginning, the goal of JA2 Stracciatella was to modernize and improve the game, without altering its gameplay.
