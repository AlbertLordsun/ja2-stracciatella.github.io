The release of the map editor together with UB spawned hundreds of user-made maps and campaigns.
SOG'69 is one of the most popular user-made campaigns (if no **the** most popular) for UB ever made.
It takes the player to the Vietnam war, which is a totally new setting for a Jagged Alliance game.
The amount of content and it's high level of immersion is second to none. This mod is an absolute must-play for everyone who owns UB.
