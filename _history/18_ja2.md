This is mostly just a re-release of the original JA1. Some minor gameplay elements were changed. While this whole project was definitely a very nice idea, it also showed, how badly the first Jagged Alliance game has aged.
And by badly aged, I'm not referring to the graphics, but to the controls and interface, which are by far less userfriendly than in JA2.
Now, if they would have ported JA2, that would have been truly amazing!
