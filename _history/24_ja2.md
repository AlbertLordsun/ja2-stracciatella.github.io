This is basically the same game as JAO, but it changed from a free2play title to a classic buy2play game.
This is definitely a huge step forward, but this game is nevertheless not very good. It has some DLC's available, but that doesn't improve the situation. JAO and AO:R are probably the most obscure titles in this list.
