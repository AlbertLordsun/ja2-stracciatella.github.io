A remake of JA2. While it's not really a bad game, the only new and innovative thing BiA brought to the Jagged Alliance franchise besides better graphics is: DLC's. And thinking about it... this is in fact a very bad thing.
Obligatory DLC-rant aside, this game and it's sequel are probably the best "modern" games with the Jagged Alliance name on them. Of course, this doesn't mean too much, since the competition with everything on this list after JA2 is rather weak.
